# TODO

## Project Description

I created an application that allows users to:

- create, read, update, and delete tasks, reminders, ideas & memories (TRIM).
- fill out customizable forms that take into account due dates, durtations, categories, priority and more!
- view entries in a table format with an option to expand and view lengthy text and full images
- Has an option to review feedback and if changes need to be made, users can update their info.
- When feedback has been submitted, send & store the submission in a database.
- Implement Material UI for buttons & input fields.
- Pauses & guides a user's flow to fill out portions of the form that are incomplete.

### Duration: 2 Weeks
